# ParallelMatrixCalulator
## Parallel programming project for COP 4520 Group 27
As of now we have completed the sequential algorithms
for matrix multiplication, matrix addition, matrix subtraction,
matrix transposition, and scalar multiplication.
In addition we have completed research upon matrix parallel
algorithms. Furthermore, we have completed the parallel algo-
rithms for matrix multiplication and matrix transposition. One
of our group members developed a graphical user interface
(GUI) for our matrix calculator to streamline and make the experience more user friendly


HOW TO COMPILE:

Open a terminal in directory containing files

<br>

To run main matrix calculator program, type:

javac Matrix.java

java Matrix

The terminal will then prompt the user for input through the command line.

To see demo of GUI, type:

javac MatrixRedone.java

java MatrixRedone
